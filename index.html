Then they can enter their first name, last name, phone number, email address, along with their CUNY EMPLID number. Then the user can save this contact so that it appears on the list of contacts on the left side, which is sorted alphabetically,. If the user wants to delete a contact they can select it from the sorted list on the left by clicking it and hitting the delete button, and that contact will be removed from the list. Then when the user has decided that they have added enough contacts and want to export the information while also saving and exiting the program, they can hit the 'Export as a .txt file' button, the program will prompt the user to look for an .txt file within file explorer or Finder, and then it will overwrite the information into the text file, and terminate. </p>

				<p> My interests include playing video games, creating video-games inside the Unity game engine, and watching Anime. My favorite musical artists and composers are deadmau5, Beethoven, Fedrick Chopin, Hiroyuki Sawano, Hanz Zimmer, and Eminem. Regardless of genre I generally prefer non-vocal instrumental music as it keeps me more productive. My hobbies range from writing, to sketching, building computers, testing the limits of Gnome3 extensions in Ubuntu, trying other linux distro's, and making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxel</a> art!</p>
